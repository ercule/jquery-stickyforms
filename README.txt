RWSApps StickyForms jQuery Plugin

Automatically saves all form fields into cookies, and then autofills those values on any form that shares element IDs across your site.

StickyForms gives you the ability to control:

* Which element types (text, checkbox, select-one, etc.) that you want to be sticky.
* Any element IDs you want excluded (e.g. #password).
* The length of the cookie lifetime for the sticky property.
* The flexibility to specify the scope of the sticky behavior to a single form, or across all forms on your site.
* The ability to enable debugging and automatic disabling of the StickyForms plugin.
